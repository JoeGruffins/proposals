# Decred Proposals

This repository collects any useful materials related to proposals that didn't fit [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/):

- updates for approved proposals (progress and sometimes finances)
- analyses of pros/cons/risks/challenges
- auxiliary docs
- pre-proposal drafts and research
- translations of proposals

Navigation:

- updates are in the [proposals](proposals) directory
- drafts are saved as Pull Requests [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/pulls)
- other useful docs and links are in the [topics](directory)

To **submit your update** please create a pull request adding a file to the appropriate subdirectory under [proposals](proposals), or create an [issue](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/issues) if you need help.
