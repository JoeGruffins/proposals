This is a compilation of issues discussed related to market making proposals.

## Pros

### Pro: Better experience for people sellig and buying for DCR

> Imagine you want to sell me your used car for $5k and I offer to pay you in DCR. If I pay you with DCR using the last print as the price and your immediately selling that DCR would result in you receiving $4.5k that would not be a great offer. Having a MM there to absorb your sell order very close to the last trade price significantly enhances the user experience, and you get your $5k.

### Pro: Better liquidity for contractors

Special case of the above, but is worth an explicit mention.

### Pro: Attract more investors

> The need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand. (@maxbronstein on [2019-08-12](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/29))

> With the increased liquidity and volumes, the asset will become available to a new class of investors, particularly institutional investors with strict liquidity requirements in their holdings. Where today, even if these investors had an interest in Decred, would be barred or limited in the size of holding due to the lack of liquidity available today. (@jyashouafar on [2019-08-13](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/36))

### Pro: Make Decred more visible

> With higher volume numbers, more people will see DCR and some exchanges might consider listing DCR on their platform. (u/GrapefruitTrading on [2019-08-09](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cnmc0o/market_making_proposal_grapefruit_trading/ewffhwv/))

### Pro: Stabilize the market

> Not matter how much DCR price has changed, we will always be there (as we signed the contract). We can be the last guy you can find in the market to trade with. We provide liquidity and provide our protect to stabilize the market (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/14))

### Pro: Experiment to try

Counter-arguments:

> people are saying "it is an experiment", but the proposals are not set-up with the scope, timeline, or cost structure of an experiment (@betterfuture on [2019-08-11](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/19))

## Cons

### Con: Too expensive

MM cost [varies](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest/blob/master/issue-020.md) between $31-47K per month, or $185-283K for 6 months.

> Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly 10% of the current treasury inflow. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become 20% of the current treasury inflow. (@solar on [2019-08-11](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/16))

### Con: Coins should not pay for MM

> If all top coins in cryptospace hiring them doesnt mean its the right way to go. Communities of those coins never being asked what ppl think about hiring them. (@rickshaw on [2019-08-15](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/41))

## Concerns

### Concern: Paid MM may attract attention from regulators

... or even increase the security-ness of DCR

Discussions:

* [2019-08-05](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cm2uw1/decred_only_needs_one_market_maker/ew1jp6y/): subsidizing MM action will lower Decred's "regulatory compliance score", on the other hand SEC has bigger fish to fry atm and by the time they get to Decred the Treasury may be (more) decentralized 
* [2019-08-09](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/25): this concern only applies to securities and there are no clear regulatory guidelines
* [2019-08-10](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/5): MMs will only provide maker liquidity; whether DCR is a security

Counter-arguments:

> every major crypto project engages MMs and we've never seen it called out as an issue (@jz on [2019-08-11](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/14))

> in traditional market, providing liquidity at the early stage of a financial product, even at cost, is a common practice to incentivize trading and further liquidity. This is often done by the exchange itself. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-14](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/35))

### Concern: Why MM's can't prove their value upfront, like everybody else?

> Why can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels? (@betterfuture on [2019-08-11](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/19))

## Q & A

### Why exchanges don't pay for MM instead?

> MM is so common in the equity market, even Apple and Google have their market makers providing liquidity to their stakeholders. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-09](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/18))

### What is the onboarding fee, why so much?

> setting up market making strategy is far from an easy task. Since DCR has been trading across various exchanges and we have to set different accounts and handle various exchange exceptions. There are tons of different exceptions you may encounter if you are familiar with these exhcanges. It is quite a burden for our team to have everything running smoothly 24/7, and that's why we charge onboarding fee. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-09](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/19))

### Can you run out of inventory?

> not likely, the Market making strategy will rebalance itself. \[in the case of an extreme movement in price\] yes possible but as long as there are price takers on the opposite direction and within our risk level, we can balance it back. So far we have not run into any issues like this. Our stress tested model also justifies this. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-14](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/32))

> This is not a concern - we manage inventory by consistently rebalancing when we become overly weighted one way from the price moving one direction. The community should not have to worry about this issue. (@i2trading on [2019-08-13](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/48))

### How large market buys or sells are handled?

> I think of a trade that is over $1m, our bots would absolutely improve liquidity for the trader. Depending on how much more trading happens on exchange once the program begins, its possible that the trader would be able to comfortably execute this order entirely on exchange. I would however recommend that a trade of that size be executed OTC for the best overall experience. Our desk is willing to inventory risk of that size, and therefore the trader would end up with a very good price and less market risk. We have routinely done trades of this size, and our clients were happy with the outcome. (@i2trading on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/14))

> While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.

### How bad market conditions are handled?

> richardred: I was wondering about the significance of the uptime too, seems like a big difference between 100% and 90% if it means MM will be sitting out 10% of the time when things get rough.  
> jy-p: it strikes me as giving them leeway to turn off their bots when the market gets really directional, to be sure they don't get run over  
> max_bronstein: this is precisely correct. and it's better for the project. If an MM is caught offsides, they end up holding a bunch of excess inventory which they will try and sell off most likely  
> jy-p: yep. they're not there to stabilize or otherwise control the market so much as add depth so ppl can get on and off the dcr ride (chat on [2019-08-09](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156538185512711OSiGO:decred.org))

### How losses during exceptional events are handled?

> * Trading losses to be borne by i2 Trading.
> * Exchange hacks/external operational losses borne by lender. (@i2trading on [2019-08-07](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9))

> Grapefruit Trading has no liability on any amount of loaned DCR that is lost in the event that the above exchanges loses or absconds with them (hack, exit scam, etc). (@grapefruittrading on [2019-08-07](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b))

### Can we control to which markets liquidity is provided?

> The pairs we plan to provide liquidity for will be Binance DCR/BTC, Bittrex DCR/USDT, Bittrex DCR/BTC, OkCoin DCR/USD, though these pairs can be changed should the relevant Decred parties deem it in the network’s best interest (e.g., a new exchange listing). (@grapefruittrading on [2019-08-07](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b))

### Will you increase trading volume?

> One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. (@grapefruittrading on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/6))

### How will you report?

> We will provide reports on the total Decred volume (not just our trading) in all the markets we are participating in. Over time, this should demonstrate the increase in DCR trading, which could be valuable to the community. (@i2trading on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/14))

> We will be happy to provide a quarterly reporting statement of all the trades we conducted, and how much liquidity we added to the market. We think this is a good idea. (@i2trading on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/10))

> we can provide a monthly report (@grapefruittrading on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/13))

### How can we verify your activity?

> We trade through API. The account itself is completely transparent to the team. Team will have login to view everything. We have nothing to hide. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-14](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/38))

> user39390: may be a read-only api key access to verify trading activity of MM, just saying. not sure if possible :)  
> i2trading: I think we would be open to this as long as it stayed in the hands of a key DCR rep and nobody else. (chat on [2019-08-08](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org))

### Do you make profit?

> Intuitively, we can make profits with our market making strategies by buying low from one client and selling high to another client because our high frequency strategy can make decisions within milliseconds, much faster than normal people especially when market moves a lot.
> 
> However, the profit we gain is generated from the market, which means, we take profits from you, from the Decred community. The more profits we gain, the more money you guys lose.
> 
> We're here to help Decred communities, to let more people involve and let those who got interested recently can get a chance to have their own DCR tokens and join the community. It's not fair for them to pay a higher price and lose money, that is why we decide to gain $0 profit from the market. (@runchen of Altonomy on [2019-08-08](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/7))
