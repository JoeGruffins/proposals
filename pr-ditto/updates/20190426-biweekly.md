Hi everyone. Here's the bi-weekly update on what Ditto's been up to the past two weeks and what's coming in the next two weeks.

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- We've been focused on organizing the logistics of BreakerCon - the event Ditto and BREAKERMAG are co-hosting on the sidelines of NYBW (May 15). Decred will feature prominently at the event: Jake will speak on a panel called "The Idealist's Dilemma" about decentralization, which will be a debate among @jy-p, Ryan Taylor of Dash, Alexander Zaidelson of Beam, and Tal Kol of Orbs. BreakerCon will be an all-day event featuring big names like CryptoKitties, Ledger, Nic Carter, Peter McCormack, Murad Mahmudov, etc. Lots of journalists will be there, as well. More about BreakerCon here: https://breakermag.com/announcing-breakercon-2019-breakermag-but-live/ . Additionally, we'd appreciate your help spreading the word by RT'ing or otherwise engaging with this tweet: https://twitter.com/DittoPA/status/1121612865050484738
- Attended SF Decred meetup at Coinbase HQ. Turnout was great (probably 60-70 people), and it really feels like a community is beginning to develop around Decred out here. Big shoutout to @max\_bronstein for his work on this.
- Facilitated interview between @jy-p and the Hacker Noon podcast, which is pending publication (we'll post it here once it goes live, both as a YouTube video and a podcast).
- Facilitated an interview between @jz and The Block on Decred's experience listing on Binance. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/04/17/binance-wants-crypto-projects-to-migrate-to-its-chain-from-ethereum-and-the-firms-massive-trading-business-could-help/
- Media trained @s\_ben to be able to speak to reporters about what it's like to work as a Decred contractor.
- Researched and created byline content around the philosophical underpinnings of and Decred's approach to staking (this is still in draft mode and will be shared out soon).

## What we're doing in the next two weeks

- Preparing for BreakerCon and flying out to NYC to meet up with some Decred community members during NYBW.
- Organizing a Ditto AMA, aiming for roughly mid-May (details coming soon!).
- As you know, our contract is up on May 31, which means we'll be putting together a new proposal for continued work. Of course, that'll open up an opportunity for discussion with the community around the success of our efforts and Decred's needs. Our proposal will be submitted onto Politeia sometime towards the end of May.

And finally, we have an exciting announcement to make. You may recall Leslie Ankney of Forbes, who has written a few positive articles about Decred in the last few months. Here's one of them to refresh your memory: https://www.forbes.com/sites/leslieankney/2019/02/04/no-more-trading-or-listing-fees-decred-releases-new-dex-proposal/

Starting on May 6, "Crypto Leslie" will cross over from journalism to PR as a Ditto employee! Leslie, who is one of the most respected journalists in the crypto space, is a huge fan of Decred and specifically requested that we give her the chance to work with you. So Leslie will become part of the Ditto-Decred team along with @margaret\_mei and me. We'll officially introduce her to you soon.
