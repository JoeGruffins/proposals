It's been a busy and exciting couple of weeks, so there's a lot to share in Ditto's bi-weekly update today.

## What we've been up to the past 2 weeks

- Secured an interview for @lukebp in The Daily Chain podcast, with the episode scheduled to release soon. You can see Luke's tweet here - feel free to engage to drum up excitement! https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1177330930333245440
- Secured an interview for @jy-p in The Crypto Conversation podcast - a new podcast released by Brave New Coin. This episode is also set to go live in the near future; we'll share it once it's available. In the meantime, you can find the podcast here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-crypto-conversation/id1471243424
- Secured a follow-up interview for @jy-p with Alessandra Solberger, who's writing a book called Blockchain Mavericks.
- Secured a keynote speaking slot for @jy-p at the SF Bitcoin Meetup earlier this week, where he gave a presentation on the privacy landscape. There were 50+ attendees from a variety of projects. Overall a big win to have Decred speak at a Bitcoin Meetup! Jake's speech was livestreamed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgLfMLFfOHQ
- Worked with @max\_bronstein to drum up attendance at the Decred Meetup at Coinbase earlier this week. Shout-out to Max for organizing!
- Spent quality time with @anshaw and @jy-p during their visit to San Francisco.
- I was recorded on the Decred in Depth podcast with @anshaw - episode coming soon!
- Moved the Educational Resources Repository closer to completion - coming soon!
- Coordinated with the community to continue pushing Decred's privacy narrative across Twitter.

## What we're doing in the next 2 weeks

- Completing the Educational Resources Repository and working with the community to prepare it for publication
- Announcing the October Twitter topic for community engagement and continuing to coordinate with the community to educate audiences on Twitter
- Drafting a piece of content on incentives alignment and governance, for potential publication in a third-party outlet
- Coordinating with the community on potential plans for SF Blockchain Week, Web Summit, and other upcoming events
- Talking to media reporters about Decred's governance in comparison with other projects that have been in the news lately (e.g. EOS)
- Helping prepare @jy-p for his speaking engagement at Voice of Blockchain in Chicago
