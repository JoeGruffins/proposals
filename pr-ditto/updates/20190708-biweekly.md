Time for another Ditto bi-weekly update. Over the last two weeks, we've had a nice mix of events and interviews. We've also been working on Educational and Social Media resources.

- Got @jy-p's staking byline published in CoinDesk https://www.coindesk.com/staking-isnt-just-a-way-to-earn-crypto-money-and-it-shouldnt-be . Rallied the community to engage with the tweet.
- Attended Decred Dev meetup at Coinbase Custody on 6/26.
- Media trained @akinsawyerr and @elian on 6/26
- @jy-p's interview with Hacker Noon Podcast went live https://podcast.hackernoon.com/e/the-insights-of-building-decentralized-infrastructure-with-jake-yocom-piatt-of-decred/
- Made substantial progress on putting together the structure of a future educational resources repository, which will be external-facing and targeted towards people who are unacquainted with Decred and want to learn about the project.
- Met Akin Sawyerr in person on 7/1 to discuss future media appearances/topics and support his discussion at Wharton https://zicklincenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Wharton-Cryptogovernance-Workshop-7-19.pdf
