Hey all, here's a brief update of what Ditto's been up to over the past two weeks, as well as what's in store.

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- Secured an in-depth technical profile of Decred in The Block. Here's the original article behind a paywall: https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/03/20/decred-an-experiment-in-on-chain-governance/ .
- Staffed a background interview between @jz, @jy-p, and Laura Shin (the host of the Unchained/Unconfirmed podcasts). We're now working with Laura to potentially set up a recording.
- Coordinated with Pomp's Off the Chain podcast to schedule a recording with @jy-p at the end of April.
- Staffed interview with @jy-p and CryptoBriefing analyst for an in-depth research report.
- Worked with @Dustorf on format and content ideas for the Decred Assembly videos.
- Drafted high-level messaging around how ticketing works (still pending).

## What we're doing the next two weeks

- Finalizing the logistics of Decred's speaking opportunities at NY Blockchain Week.
- Securing a recording on Laura Shin's podcast.
- Telling the governance story to reporters.
- Telling the story of Decred's contractor model (i.e. "the crypto gig economy") to reporters
- Thinking through and brainstorming responses to tough questions reporters often ask in interviews.
