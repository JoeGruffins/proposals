Happy Friday, folks! Below is the bi-weekly update on what Ditto's been up to the past two weeks and what's coming in the next two weeks.

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- Officially welcomed @cryptoleslie, former Forbes contributor who has written about Decred in the past, to the Ditto-Decred team. Please give her a warm welcome!
- Final preparations for Atomic Swap, co-hosted by Ditto and The Block next Wednesday, May 15. Decred is providing swag bags + T-shirts, and the event will be attended by 7-10 Decred folks, plus 150-200 others, e.g. big names like Nic Carter, Peter McCormack, Murad Mahmudov, Chris Burniske, etc. Looking forward to meeting @jz @Dustorf @jy-p @anshaw @akinsawyerr and others in person!

- Facilitated Murad's appearance on Cheddar TV, where he mentions Decred at 2:07. An important milestone for mainstream business exposure: https://cheddar.com/media/after-40-million-hack-bitcoin-climbs-to-6-000-for-the-first-time-this-year
- Facilitated a mention of Decred in Forbes (more mainstream coverage!), where Murad is quoted: "While Bitcoin has been outperforming altcoins since April, I think altcoins which have tracked BTC movements most closely are the ones being accumulated by 'Smart money' investors and VCs: coins like Decred, Tezos, and Monero." https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/05/10/why-is-bitcoin-leaving-top-cryptos-in-the-dust/
- Per the community's request, scheduled a livestream AMA for next Friday with our CEO Trey Ditto and me. Drop your questions in reddit so we can answer them on video! https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bm9as0/ama_livestream_with_liz_and_trey_from_ditto_pr/
- Researched and created byline on the philosophical underpinnings of and Decred's approach to staking. Currently being edited by the writers and will be shared out once ready.
- Scheduled multiple media interviews for Murad and @jy-p while they're at NY Blockchain Week next week.
- Managed a Crypto101 podcast with Marco, who explains Decred to an average consumer. Starts at 7:32 https://soundcloud.com/matthew-aaron-690749808/horizen-decred-casino-coin-101
- Facilitated r/cryptocurrency AMA with @jy-p: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bjubwv/ama_decred_project_lead_jake_yocompiatt/

## What we're doing in the next two weeks

- Attending + staffing Atomic Swap next Wednesday. @jy-p will speak on the panel "The Idealist's Dilemma: Building Sustainable Decentralized Protocols", along with Ryan Taylor of Dash, Alexander Zaidelson of Beam, and Tal Kol of Orbs at 4 PM EST. We'll live Tweet from the event and share updates!
- Facilitating interviews between Murad, @jy-p, and reporters during NY Blockchain Week.
- Hosting a Ditto-Decred AMA next Friday, May 17 at 12 PM EST. This will be a livestream where we answer the questions dropped into reddit. We'll share that link out on reddit and Matrix so folks can follow along, and will also record in case anyone can't watch live.
- Putting together an updated Politeia proposal for continued work with Decred. Ditto's contract ends on May 31, so we'll draft a refreshed proposal based on the community's feedback and the AMA. We aim to submit that proposal roughly by the end of the month.
- Putting final touches on the staking byline and preparing to submit it to a media outlet for publication.
