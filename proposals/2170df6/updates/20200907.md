We have processed a total of 141 submissions so far, with 14 of them being eligible for a payout.

We have also made some rules/scope [changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty/pull/71/files) to improve the program.

Quoting notable changes:

- Please inform us if you have your own timeline for full disclosure (90 days minimum). Unless specified we will release the information at our own pace.
- Once decided, there will be no changes to the payout amount unless the vulnerability impact changes.
- For vulnerabilities that require a patch rollout and pose a risk to the network participants , we might choose to only release 60% of the payout amount first and hold the 40% until a patch has been released and distributed.
