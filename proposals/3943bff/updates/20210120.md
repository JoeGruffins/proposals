Decrediton pr waiting on review. The repo is at the point where I would like to get it into the decred repo. It too is waiting for review. I am in the process of getting the app uploaded to fdroid, though I do not know yet if there may be a problem with dependencies. They are pretty strict. I have looked into cfilters pretty thouroughly, and it is a huge job. It won't be finished by March. I will need to work on it a little at a time. It will get done when it gets done. Binaries are also available in the release files on github and can be found through the readme. Current realease is 1.06 but there will be a 1.07 if review reveals any problems.

Targets left:

- Review by other devs and move to the decred GitHub org.
- Upload to F-Droid.
- Fix bugs if found.

Long target:

- CFilters...
