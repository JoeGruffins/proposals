[Pull request](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3112) adding QR with active tickets to Decrediton is waiting for review. This will allow to add a bunch of tickets to the app with minimum hassle.

The [code repo](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/dcraddrscanner) is at the point where I would like to move it under the [decred](https://github.com/decred) GitHub org. That is too waiting for review.

I am in the process of getting the app uploaded to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/), though I do not know yet if there may be a problem with dependencies. They are pretty strict.

I have looked into cfilters pretty thouroughly, and it is a huge job. It won't be finished by March. I will need to work on it a little at a time. It will get done when it gets done.

Android binaries (APK) are also available in GitHub [releases](https://github.com/JoeGruffins/dcraddrscanner/releases) and can be found through the readme. Current realease is 1.06 but there will be a 1.07 if review reveals any problems.

Targets left:

- Review by other devs and move to the decred GitHub org.
- Upload to F-Droid.
- Fix bugs if found.

Long target:

- CFilters
