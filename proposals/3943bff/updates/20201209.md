?? - Updating to target SDK version 30 and implementation of a new QR scanner went smoothly. Will go ahead and update the Play store release, then silencing the 11 compile warnings and then new features.

12/24 - Many structual updates and much refactoring (`30 files changed, 735 insertions(+), 663 deletions(-)`). New easy to manage database using Room. Ability to choose explorers. Other minor UI updates.
