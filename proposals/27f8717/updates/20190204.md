Below is an update of Ditto's work for the past two weeks and what's to come. It's been a jam-packed couple of weeks!

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- We secured an exclusive feature article on the DEX proposal in Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/leslieankney/2019/02/04/no-more-trading-or-listing-fees-decred-releases-new-dex-proposal/
- We finalized the foundational messaging document and received positive feedback from the community. This document was a long time in the making. We're proud of how far we've come and are grateful for the community's input - it wouldn't have been possible without you. Here is the doc: https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV
- We facilitated an interview between @jy-p and Breaker Mag for a feature article being released in time for Decred's anniversary.
- We drafted an announcement of Decred's bug bounty program, set one of Decred's community members up as a contributor to Hacker Noon, and got the announcement placed in Hacker Noon - thereby reaching a much broader pool of developers than Decred would otherwise reach via its own channels. This contributorship on Hacker Noon could serve us well when Decred has announcements it wants to push out to a broad audience. https://hackernoon.com/decred-launches-debug-decred-bug-bounty-program-7e4d2af27ec9
- We submitted an application for @jy-p to speak at Consensus 2019.
- We facilitated an interview between Joshua and Bitsonline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxDxJ4YAUA
- We scheduled an opportunity for @jy-p to appear on BlockTV to talk about Decred.
- We worked closely with @Dustorf on an events plan that encompasses both events Decred wants to speak at and events it wants to have a booth at.

## What we're doing the next two weeks

- With messaging out of the way, we're pivoting towards the creation of a master marketing and communications plan for H1 2019.
- We anticipate a Breaker Mag feature on Decred for its 3rd anniversary. Breaker Mag is also interested in doing a lengthier Q&A with @jy-p.
- We're working out the concepts and logistics of Decred's presence at Consensus.
- We're media training for 5 community members so that we're getting multiple stakeholders in front of the media.

## 1 thing we learned about the community this week

We learned that "stakey squat" is a thing, but we're still not quite sure what it means.
