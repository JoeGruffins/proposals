Hey everybody. Here's our bi-weekly update on what Ditto's been doing the last two weeks and what's coming up in the next two weeks.

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- Co-hosted, along with crypto outlet The Block, an event on the sidelines of NY Blockchain Week called Atomic Swap, of which Decred was a sponsor (you can find pics on Twitter if you search the hashtag #atomicswapnyc). The event was a huge success, with 200+ people attending, including journalists from Bloomberg, Fortune, The Block, Bitcoin Magazine, etc. Decred was a lead sponsor of Atomic Swap, which many said was "the best event at Blockchain Week", and @jy-p spoke on a panel about decentralization with Dash, Beam, and Orbs. Decred tote bags and t-shirts were handed out to attendees, who were crypto influencers, media, investors, and enthusiasts.
- Set up in-person meetings for @jy-p and Murad with reporters from BTC Manager, The Information, and Bitcoin Magazine. Jake and Murad complement each other well in interviews. Jake proves background and detail on Decred, while Murad offers broader context on crypto finance and an investor perspective. The Information quoted Jake in a story about the launch of Spedn: https://www.theinformation.com/articles/can-crypto-crack-the-retail-market
- Team Ditto meet several Decred community members in person during NYBW, including @akinsawyerr, @anshaw, @jholdstock, @lukebp, @jy-p, @jz, @Dustorf.
- Our CEO Trey and I live-streamed the Decred Reddit AMA on YouTube and fielded questions from Matrix for a full hour. If you missed it live, you can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8XjAOMX-VM . Also, if you'd like to see the Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/bm9as0/ama_livestream_with_liz_and_trey_from_ditto_pr/ . We answered the community's questions about Ditto's first 6-month engagement, which ends this month. We'll be submitting a new proposal to Politeia sometime next week, so be on the look-out!
- Secured a mention of Decred in BTCManager. Also, check out the graphic! https://btcmanager.com/blockchains-neglect-social-contracts-will-likely-fail/
- Secured a speaking slot for @jy-p about decentralization and Decred's funding mechanism at the Voice of Blockchain, an event that will take place in Chicago this fall.

## What we're doing in the next two weeks

- Finalizing the staking byline we've been collaborating on with the community and submitting it to a media outlet for publication.
- Finalizing an infographic on staking that we've been collaborating on with @richardred.
- Facilitating and staffing several podcast interviews with @jy-p and Murad.
- Drafting and submitting a new six-month communications proposal to Politeia based on the questions we received during the AMA and feedback from the community. We'll be on call to answer any questions that come through on Politeia, Reddit, or Matrix during the proposal phase.
