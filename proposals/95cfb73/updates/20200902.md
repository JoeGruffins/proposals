## Metrics from Phase 1

(quote from Phase 2 proposal)

Metrics are an important way to gauge what works and what doesn't work. While we have to trust 3rd party platforms for these gameable analytics, I believe the metrics provided by YouTube are for the most part accurate.

| Like %        | 98.9%   |
