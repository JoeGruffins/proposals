Due to the massive price action in last weeks, I've suspended the giveaways as it seems no longer necessary to generate social buzz. At the time of activity, [@withDecred](https://twitter.com/withdecred) Twitter account had around 100K impressions monthly and generated some good conversations (and some shilling as well).

It seems that the release of DCRDEX + amazing work of [Check](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_) (around 400K impressions monthly on his tweets if I remember correctly) + all other active community members sparkled growth of social activity which was picked multiple times also by "social trackers" on Twitter.

I'm now thinking how to go forward from here with WithDecred activities (web + Twitter), for the moment I'm supporting community-created content. IF you have some suggestions, feel free to ping me here or on Twitter.

Thanks to everybody for support and mutual work!
