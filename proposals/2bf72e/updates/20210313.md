Hi all,

bee asked me if I could write more information about the DCR community distribution - some stats and amounts.

In total, there was 11.6 DCR distributed to community in 5 rounds. The amount was usually $30 or $40 USD in USD terms in date (month) of distribution.

I distributed via [@withDecred](https://twitter.com/withDecred) Twitter account, which saw on average 6.98% growth while doing these activities. On average, the posts had around 6,150 impressions with a 8.78% engagement rate.

From subjective perspective, I saw that people were more engaged on Twitter, even new faces (even without being rewarded). Overall the withDecred Twitter account saw about 100K+ impressions per 28 days (period shown by Twitter analytics) over the months of performed activity.

The website [withDecred.org](https://withdecred.org/) didn't see much traffic (few thousands), hence we boiled down the content to a giant tweet-storm pinned on withDecred Twitter profile. Besides that $234 USD was invoiced for few hours of work + server expenses (right now, the servers are still running but I'm not charging anything anymore).

Feel free to [ping me](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#proposals:decred.org) with any questions.
