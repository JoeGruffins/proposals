Editor note: comments below were posted to address @bee's question about project status.

**@Checkmate**

Quick comment from me, not dead at all, I am working my way around the code (not a web dev but learning) to add additional charts and content. No CoC \[[checkonchain.com](https://checkonchain.com/)\] does not replace it, that is my personal venture. I would like to implement more charts but work 3 jobs + decred so things take time. Pavel also had a new addition to the family so is similarly busy.

In short, life is busy, project is not dead and it is on my infinite list of actions. Help desirable if possible. Anyone have a cloning device?

**@pavel**

Similar here, just switched focus on family and my job for last few months. Check is in charge of this, we recently discussed what's next. When the time is right we can advance this forward again.

Anonymous analytics were not implemented as Check wanted to wait to see response from the community. I implemented the analytics on withDecred.org, there it's working alright.

The code is also open-sourced here, in case anybody wants to contribute.
