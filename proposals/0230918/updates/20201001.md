(also posted and discussed in the [#general chat](https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$-_q-N8jsWz6js1C66s0JLYeiF8NKKnBiKarVYrGSKdI))

Hi all, Check is extremely busy these days, so he asked me to the announcement.

The website is up and running - https://dcronchain.com/

In this 1st version, the website includes 5 charts which show the strength via on-chain analyses created by Checkmate and PermabullNino

- Mayer Multiple (showcased also on the homepage)
- MVRV Ratio Valuation
- Relative BTC Realised Cap and MVRV ratio
- Market-realised Gradient Oscillator
- Unrealised PnL

Personal note: I have to say for myself, that this shorter format, always accessible online is much more accessible to me to digest and understand than the long(er) deep-dive research which is usually published on Medium

As I wrote, this is the first version and we plan to continue improving the website, but we would also like to ask for your feedback, I would specially put emphasis to get feedback about the charts/research -> there are people in crypto communities who are keen on using such analyses as a proof of strength and value of particular blockchain networks, eg. "Our Network" newsletter by Spencernoon - https://twitter.com/OurNetwork__

Some notes about the process / website:

- We spent more time on Homepage design, as it was a bit challenging to decide what to display and how to display it. I think that we can still improve based on received feedback from all of you
- There's some calculation problem of Market Cap on the Homepage, we will fix it
- The site has no tracking
- The site requires JS, as the data is requested on client side and also charts are drawn on client side
- There is no dark mode (yet) and there are no translations yet - something which can be improved in future versions
- We were around 2-3 weeks late compared to initial timeline, but we stayed within requested budget

I hope we will use this website + the on-chain research it includes to help us grow the Decred ecosystem and help us communicate Decred's strength using these hard concrete data.

Feel free to write your thoughts and feedback in comments below.
