Hi all, thanks for all the feedback! I really appreciate that it, you could have caught many things which I missed. Honestly, I could have catched more of these, I'm just having crazy days. But I promise to keep improving it.

- Web is now server-side rendered, so you will see much more even without JS enabled (not charts yet), cc: @davecgh
- Refactored data loading through own backend + data is cached for 10mins on server
- Firefox + Safari is fixed; waiting for somebody to confirm that iPhone works as well
- \[a moment later\] iPhone just confirmed to work by Ammar
