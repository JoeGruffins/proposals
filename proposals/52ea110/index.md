## Budget

USD 25,000 per month, USD 150,000 total.

## Billing period

This is a bit tricky:

- phase 1 contract end date was 2019-May-31 according to [May-10 update](../27f8717/updates/20190510.md)
- the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/52ea110) was submitted May-29, approved Jun-11 and mentioned a 6-month contract
- based on [Jun-7 update](../27f8717/updates/20190607.md) for phase 1 and [Jun-21](updates/20190621.md)+[Jul-8](updates/20190708.md) updates for phase 2, Ditto worked in June
- based on the above and assuming the start in June, the end would be November 30
- but [Dec-20 update](updates/20191220.md) says that phase 2 work is ending December 31, making a 7-month duration { someone please clarify this }
