Hey all, not to break the flow here, but it's that time again: Ditto's bi-weekly update. Warning: This is a long one. It's been a busy/exciting two weeks as we ramped up the new plan and got 9 pieces of media coverage.

## What we've been up to the past two weeks

- Ditto's Politeia Proposal was approved by the Decred stakeholders! Thank you for your vote of confidence. It's an absolute joy working on Decred, and we look forward to the next 6 months.
- Off the Chain podcast with @jy-p https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jake-yocom-piatt-project-lead-for-decred-crypto-ego/id1434060078?i=1000441486954
- Got @jy-p quoted in CNBC on Libra https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/facebooks-libra-will-give-billions-access-to-cryptocurrency.html
- Got @jy-p quoted in Mashable on Libra, where he was mentioned alongside heavyweights like Vlad Zamfir and CZ https://mashable.com/article/facebook-libra-experts/ . Side note: CNBC and Mashable are mainstream media reaching people who know little about crypto. By getting Decred in front of them, we're significantly expanding its reach.
- Got Decred quoted on Libra in Forbes - twice! https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/06/20/facebooks-libra-coin-is-both-vampire-project-and-regulatory-nightmare/ and https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2019/06/19/facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra-validates-blockchain-but-industry-experts-voice-concerns/
- Got Decred quoted on Libra in CoinTelegraph https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-libra-breaking-down-facebooks-new-digital-currency
- Chain Reaction podcast with @jy-p https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decreds-co-founder-jake-yocom-piatt-governance-first/id1438148082?i=1000440934337 or YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO_11gehyls . Side note - Tom O'Shaugnessy is very knowledgable and facilitated an excellent, in-depth discussion of many of Decred's nuances. This is 201 material.
- Got @jy-p quoted in on governance in CoinDesk https://www.coindesk.com/how-blockchain-voting-is-supposed-to-work-but-in-practice-rarely-does
- Got @richardred quoted in a CoinTelegraph article about CCN's "shutdown" https://cointelegraph.com/news/internet-authority-history-of-centralized-companies-being-hostile-toward-crypto
- Attended SF Bitcoin meetup, where the organizers expressed interest in organizing a governance panel with Decred as a speaker.
- Created a social media guide on delisting https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/blob/release/engagement-guide-delist.md
- Rallied the community to engage and share media coverage on social media.

## What we're doing in the next two weeks

- Get pilots/minimum viable products of Decred's educational resource repository and community empowerment apparatus up and running. The goal is to equip the community in the short-term to start evangelizing for Decred across social media, while also working on a longer-term plan that encompasses both reactive and proactive engagement. A starting base of educational resources and community engagement will allow us to test, optimize, and tweak over time.
- Identify key themes that Decred wants to own, around which to create an educational resources repository (e.g. staking/governance, institutional investment, devs, etc.). Coordinate with community members who are already involved in these efforts. Start compiling existing educational resources.
- Identify media outlets/reporters that haven't covered Decred yet so we can target them.
- Pursue opportunities to insert Decred into articles on staking/governance by monitoring the news and social media.
- Represent Decred at the OKCoin event in San Francisco next week.
- Attend the SF Decred Meetup at Coinbase Custody next week. Shoutout to @max\_bronstein for organizing.
- Media train @akinsawyerr and @elian and support Akin for the Wharton Cryptogovernance Workshop in SF.
