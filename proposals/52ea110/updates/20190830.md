## What we've been up to the past 2 weeks

- Secured 9 pieces of coverage so far on the privacy launch - a who's-who of all the top crypto media:
  - The achievement of the year: Exclusive breaking coverage on Laura Shin's Unchained (kudos to @jz for incredible delivery) - something we've been working to secure for 6+ months, and it finally happened! https://unchainedpodcast.com/after-years-of-secret-work-decred-adds-a-new-feature-privacy/
