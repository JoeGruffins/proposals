Hi everyone! The Ditto bi-weekly update is below. Please let us know if you have any questions.

## What we've been up to the past 2 weeks

- Secured an end-of-year op-ed by @jy-p in CoinDesk with the headline "It's Time to Walk the Talk on Decentralized Governance" https://www.coindesk.com/its-time-to-walk-the-talk-on-decentralized-governance
- Arranged and attended a media tour with @Akin in NYC, where he interviewed with The Block, Fortune, Pomp's Off the Chain podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNg5G_EZxtU), and the Chain Reaction podcast (pending publication).
- Arranged for @Akin to appear live on Nasdaq TradeTalks, where he talked about Africa, governance, and Decred https://www.pscp.tv/w/1gqxvgEBqRkKB
- Crowdsourced nominations for a Twitter poll on Decred's most noteworthy achievement of 2019. The winner was the privacy implementation, with 36.6% of the vote, followed by Politeia & DAO progress (33.1%). 475 people participated in the poll. https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1207060170855141376
- Secured commentary by @richardred in CoinDesk on the sale of the .org domain to a private buyer and how this might impact Decred https://www.coindesk.com/planned-sale-of-org-angers-many-open-source-crypto-developers
- Staffed 2 tier-one interviews with @Akin which are pending publication (we'll share the info once they go live).

## What we're doing in the next 2 weeks

- Preparing @Akin for the Digital Money Forum at CES in January, where we arranged for him to speak on a panel called "The Libra Effect", sharing the stage with heavyweights like Michael Casey of CoinDesk and Dante Disparte of the Libra Association. The topic will be: "It's 2019 and everyone is a bank! Facebook's Libra, Google, Uber and others want you to bank with them. Michael Casey (CoinDesk) and Dante Disparte (Libra Foundation) kick things off, followed by some alternative views of how the future economy might work." This panel will get Decred up on stage with influential names, participating in top-tier, impactful conversations around governance.
- With phase 2 of our work together ending on December 31, we'll gear up to submit a proposal for phase 3 - coming in the first couple weeks of January.
