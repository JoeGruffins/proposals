Hi everyone, it's time for Ditto's bi-weekly update!

## What we've been up to the past 2 weeks

- Secured an op-ed for @jy-p in CoinTelegraph titled "Secrets They Missed at DevCon: What It's Really Like in a Working DAO" https://cointelegraph.com/news/secrets-they-missed-at-devcon-what-its-really-like-in-a-working-dao
- Secured an interview for @jy-p on the Base Layer podcast with David Nage ([iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/base-layer-episode-086-jake-yocom-piatt-decred/id1445373535?i=1000457565007), [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-9ah38-c88678)). If you like what you hear, reply to or retweet the tweet! https://twitter.com/DavidJNage/status/1197875645319172096
- Secured @jy-p's commentary in a Forbes article on the race between governments, corporations, and crypto to remake the financial system. Here's a good quote: "Yocom-Piatt predicted that many digital currencies people think of as being a store of value (SOV), for example bitcoin and decred, will survive." https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/11/11/who-will-win-the-race-for-digital-currency-supremacy/
- Helped coordinate an interview for @jy-p on the Market Disruptors podcast https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/developing-privacy-on-the-blockchain-with-jake-yocom/id1463411709?i=1000457462441
- Secured a feature article on Decred's privacy in a new crypto outlet called Crypto Trader News https://cryptotradernews.com/technology/our-data-privacy-is-under-attack-decred-is-fighting-back/
- Secured an interview between @Akin and the Nakamoto News Network at the World Crypto Conference in Las Vegas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6z9JZxRRI
- Secured several podcast and online interviews for various community members. We'll share the details once they go live.
- Drafted an op-ed on the topic of governance, which is pending publication in a top-tier media outlet (we'll share details as soon as it publishes).
- Neared completion on the educational resources repository, which is undergoing final touches on the back-end.
- Identified and shared opportunities for the community to engage with Crypto Twitter and educate outsiders about Decred.
- Had some fun participating in the #DecredDanceChallenge on Twitter - if you haven't already, you should, too! If you don't know what that is, do a search for the hashtag [#DecredDanceChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DecredDanceChallenge) and enjoy. :)

## What we're doing in the next 2 weeks

- Actively organizing a "media tour" for @Akin in NYC (as I mentioned last time, a media tour is where we set up a series of interviews and coffees with local reporters - both online and broadcast - in a short period of time). We'll position Akin as an expert on governance, crypto in Africa, and Decred. Since most reporters are based in NYC, this will be a good opportunity for them to get face time with the project.
- Continuing to educate top-tier crypto journalists about DAOs and positioning Decred as a central player in the movement.
- Continuing to keep the community engaged on Twitter by identifying conversations to join.
- We're anticipating a few podcast and online interviews to go live in the coming weeks - we'll keep you posted on anything that comes in.
