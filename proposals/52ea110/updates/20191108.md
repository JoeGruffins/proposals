Hi everyone, we're happy to share the latest bi-weekly update! Let us know if you have any questions.

## What we've been up to the past 2 weeks

- Secured an interview for @jy-p on the Messari podcast about developer funding, governance, and Decred. Before Ryan (the founder of Messari) started recording, he said he's noticed Decred has been getting lots of buzz relative to other top 100 cryptocurrencies. That was wonderful to hear! https://messari.io/podcast/developer-funding-governance-and-the-evolution-of-decred-with-jake-yocom-piatt . And here's the tweet if you'd like to engage: https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1191783062037766144
- Secured an interview for @jy-p on BlockTV about resolving corporate governance in cryptocurrency. Shout-out to Jake for that wall art! https://blocktv.com/watch/2019-10-30/5db9ab4487a7e-resolving-corporate-governance-in-cryptocurrency . Here's the tweet if you'd like to engage: https://twitter.com/BLOCKTVnews/status/1189566025496514566
- I appeared on the Decred in Depth podcast to talk about Ditto's work with Decred, crypto PR, etc. Thanks to @anshaw for hosting me - I had so much fun! https://soundcloud.com/decredindepth/ep-11-liz-bagot-pr-marketing . (I also dressed as [Stakey](https://twitter.com/liz_bagot/status/1190056081491316736) for Halloween and got lots of eyeballs at SF Blockchain Week!).
- Supported Decred's media presence at Web Summit by securing an interview with BBC, as well as supplying the team with a briefing book of journalists to find and talk to (e.g. Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, etc.). We also helped prep Marco for his panel discussion.
- Supported @Akin's presence at the World Crypto Conference in Las Vegas by setting up on-the-ground interviews with media outlets like Legacy Research, CryptoBeadles, Crypto TV News, etc. Digit-All has uploaded their interview to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6z9JZxRRI). We'll share any other forthcoming media coverage once it's live.
- Drafted two op-eds on the topics of governance and DAOs, which are pending publication in top-tier media outlets (we'll share details as soon as we near publication date).
- Identified and shared opportunities for the community to engage with Crypto Twitter and educate outsiders about Decred.

## What we're doing in the next 2 weeks

- Talking to journalists and coordinating several interviews for Decred community members around the race between corporations, central banks, and decentralized cryptocurrencies (like Decred) to remake the monetary system.
- Scheduling several podcast interviews for various community members.
- Gearing up for a "media tour" for @Akin in NYC (a media tour is where we set up a series of interviews and coffees with local reporters - both online and broadcast - in a short period of time). We'll position Akin as an expert on governance, crypto in Africa, and Decred. Since most reporters are based in NYC, this will be a good opportunity for them to get face time with the project.
- Working with the community to finalize the Educational Resources Repository before it goes live. If anyone in the community has a resource (e.g. Medium post, news article, podcast, video, etc.) they consider to be particularly useful in learning about Decred, please drop it in this room and we'll incorporate it into the repo. Once the repo is live, we'll regularly update it with fresh links as high-quality new resources are produced, so that it's up-to-date and contains all the best information.
- Continuing to keep the community engaged on Twitter by identifying conversations to join.
