Hey guys, I want to apologize for dropping the ball with the Facebook admin proposal after only a couple months in and specifically/especially for not showing up to say anything about it out of embarrassment and anxiety. I don't have a good excuse for it but I will say I feel March and the first half of this year really threw me a curve ball when everybody was sent home over covid-19 hysteria, and my priorities shifted as things seemed much less stable in my life. I never billed for the work I did in March because I had started to neglect the work that month and I just got more removed from it as time went on, justifying it in my head as if it'd be time billed during a time when it seemed like the juice wasn't worth the squeeze for the project and needing to prioritize other things. I'm sure I have disappointed some and I understand having lost respect, but I wanted to say something for myself about it despite it being 6 months late. I apologize for not communicating when my circumstances changed and for not following through on the proposal.
