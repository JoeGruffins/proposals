Update 3: Grapefruit's offer is framed differently (in terms of "bid to ask") to the others (in terms of the spread from mid) - so 2% bid to ask is largely equivalent to 1% spread, except that the offer could be asymetrical around the price. This [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/5) explains it.

Update 2: Grapefruit have confirmed that the only loan they require is the DCR one. Added note about no layering on Grapefruit offer.

Update 1:

i2 have clarified that the loan figure in their proposal covers all required loans, so that is cut in half. I am also now assuming that as Grapefruit does not mention a loan other than the DCR one that this covers their inventory requirements.

Grapefruit have clarified that they would not charge trading fees to the Treasury, which sets their proposal apart from the other two because there is no additional unknown charge for trading fees to consider.

## Market Maker proposal cost estimates

Estimated costs are based on $30/DCR. I don't know what a good estimate of trading fees would be, but they would also be billed to the Treasury by i2 and Altonomy, the i2 proposal caps this at $20k/month but does not expect to reach that limit.

### Altonomy

- Most expensive (due to higher inventory requirements), liquidity not as tight around the price as i2, most pairs, highest uptime

**Offer:**

0.3% spread

Layered depth, $5k/1%, $20k/2%, $50k/5%

10 pairs

100% uptime

**Cost:**

USD 30k/month + 1k DCR ($30k) onboarding = $210k for 6 months or $35k/month

**Loans:**

3k DCR/pair - 30k DCR for 10 pairs = 900k USD, assume monthly interest of 0.8% = $43k

70k USD per pair - 700k USD for 10 pairs, assume monthly interest of 1% = $42k

Total indicative cost for 6 months (trading fees would be added): **$295,000**



### i2 Trading

- Highest liquidity close to trading price

**Offer:**

0.3% BTC spread, 0.5% USD spread

Layered depth, $10k/1%, $30k/2%, $50k/4%

6 pairs

90% uptime

**Cost:**

USD 40k/month = $240k for 6 months

**Loans:**

5k DCR/pair = 30k DCR for 6 pairs = 900k USD, assume monthly interest of 0.8% = $43k

Total indicative cost for 6 months (trading fees would be added up to $20k/month): **$283,000**


### Grapefruit Trading

- Cheaper, looser spread, lower liquidity, less uptime. Only proposal which does not require reimbursement of trading fees.

**Offer:**

2% bid to ask spread (they also quote figures for 4%), which is equivalent to the 1% spread level (from current price) as the other proposals quote it.

$30k each side

4 pairs

80% uptime

**Cost:**

$40k/month = $240k for 6 months

**Loans:** 

$90k/pair = 12k DCR or $360k, assume monthly interest of 0.8% = $17k

Total indicative cost for 6 months (including trading fees) : **$257,000**
