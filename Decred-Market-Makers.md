Update 4: Added Tantra offer and updated i2 offer. Altonomy withdrew their offer.

Update 3: Grapefruit's offer is framed differently (in terms of "bid to ask") to the others (in terms of the spread from mid) - so 2% bid to ask is largely equivalent to 1% spread, except that the offer could be asymetrical around the price. This [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/5) explains it.

Update 2: Grapefruit have confirmed that the only loan they require is the DCR one. Added note about no layering on Grapefruit offer.

Update 1:

i2 have clarified that the loan figure in their proposal covers all required loans, so that is cut in half. I am also now assuming that as Grapefruit does not mention a loan other than the DCR one that this covers their inventory requirements.

Grapefruit have clarified that they would not charge trading fees to the Treasury, which sets their proposal apart from the other two because there is no additional unknown charge for trading fees to consider.

## Market Maker proposal cost estimates

Estimated costs are based on $30/DCR. I don't know what a good estimate of trading fees would be, but they would also be billed to the Treasury by i2 and Altonomy, the i2 proposal caps this at $20k/month but does not expect to reach that limit.

### Tantra

- No trading fees, making this the cheapest offer by some distance, but calling into question whether the plan is realistic.

### Grapefruit Trading

- Cheaper, lower liquidity, less uptime. Only proposal which does not require reimbursement of trading fees.
