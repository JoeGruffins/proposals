## Introduction

BIPs are design documents for introducing new features into Bitcoin (similar "improvement proposal" systems exist for other blockchain projects). For example, [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille introduced HD wallets into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This greatly simplified private key management and allowed for deterministic wallets to be interchanged between different clients or backed up through the use of seed words. Although not specifically designed for Decred, BIPs like this example have been successfully integrated into Decred helping advance the Decred project. Since the inception of Decred @davecgh estimates 4 BIPs have been incorporated.

The individuals or groups capable of developing (B)IPs represent a small pool of developers familiar with blockchain fundamentals who are interested in improving Bitcoin or their respective project. It would be to our benefit that we attract such talent. I propose using a small portion of the treasury funds as an award for (B)IP authors if their work has contributed to the advancement of the Decred project. I think 1,000 DCR per BIP [actual amount to be decided upon later: will depend on number of reward candidates and other possible expenses] represents a reasonable acknowledgement of their contribution. The reward will only be given out once in the event an author(s) has contributed more than 1 BIP.

I expect the response will lie on a continuum from "Positive" to "Indifferent" with most feeling acknowledged and validated in some way. I would expect most of them to look into the source of the reward which may form the initial point of contact into Decred. Of course, not everybody that looks at Decred will be attracted to it and it is entirely possible that they may move on to sell their reward. That said I believe programmers with an understanding of blockchain fundamentals will appreciate the unique features offered by our project and hopefully this will incentivize them to contribute to our code base.

Whilst most Politea proposals are priced in USD and then converted to DCR, I believe this undermines the value of giving the reward in DCR. This proposal specifically requests the reward be paid out as DCR only as doing so would can incentivize the recipient to work towards increasing the value of DCR held. Having the rewards priced in DCR only also illustrate the global nature of this project and is also symbolic of our move away from fiat.

The secondary aims of this proposal are to highlight our treasury and governance system as well as generate positive attention from outside our community. By showing our capacity to acknowledge good ideas from everywhere in the crypto space and showing how they were incorporated into Decred, we can demonstrate maturity of thought and our collective capacity in making decisions that can move the project forward. In doing this, we will ultimately bring more users and developers into our community and strengthen it.

In order to capitalize on this we will need to give our media team lead time to prepare. It would be vital to tap into media networks covering other projects so that news about Decred can break outside the bounds of /r/decred and chats - the way to break down crypto tribalism and build relationships between our community and the others.

## Financial Considerations

The only funds requested are those that go to the rewards.

- // Assuming 3-6 awards, that would be 3000-6000 DCR
- // Perhaps an alternative format to consider would be to award the 3 best (B)IPs that have improved Decred which would then limit the 'costing' of this proposal.

The author of this proposal does not request payment.

I hope the media team does not request payment as well as I feel it undermines/complicates the process or worse, make us come off looking like we are trying to profiteer from the award.

- // This may be wishful thinking on my part so will budget in here
- // [budget to complete later]
- // Perhaps they could be compensated by community donations (risky as there may be no donors...)
- // What about corporate sponsorship? (Would they go for this? Will this look bad? Worse, BACKFIRE?)
- // Could be used as proof of "work" for aspiring media contractors... (maybe nobody will take the bite)

## Execution

Award recipients will be nominated by existing developer contractors since no other group would have the required knowledge of which improvement protocols or ideas were used. Award recipients and their corresponding (B)IPs could be verified by everyone else during the "In Discussion" phase of the Politea process. The recipients will all be mentioned by name along with their contribution during the "Voting" phase of the Politea process.

- // Our contractors only need to identify the idea and author(s) involved so this should not take long.
- // Could just post the question on Matrix (I believe all contractors use Matrix...)

Outreach to (B)IP authors should be done by individuals well known, ideally both within the Decred community and also on social media. Direct contact should be sought with the authors first followed by contact over social media channels. Permission for a short video interview (30 minutes) would be sought and should focus on the reason the (B)IP was created.

- // I'm thinking: Checkmate, richardred, Exitus, permabullnino, jz, ammarooni, svitekpavel [feel free to add your name here!]
- // They've not been approached yet!

Since we would know who the reward recipients will be in advance of the recipients themselves, we should take the opportunity to prepare some media pieces for release. The topics to focus on should include:

- Reason the (B)IP was created, the problem that it identifies and addresses
- Any barriers faced in putting the idea forward, any pushback from the intended community
- Any limitations of the original infrastructure (things that our DCPs address) that would have resulted in more seamless integration
- // who would be willing to write? Do we need to vet the documents? I would be happy to but I also realize to the community I am a reasonably unknown entity (by choice).

Our media pieces should also take the opportunity to highlight how funding was obtained to promote our self-sovereign treasury and to distinguish it from how other cryptocurrency projects are funded.

- // Obtaining expression of interest for social media personnel, interviewers, bloggers, etc.
- // If they do this for a fee we might be perceived as just doing this as a PR stunt which may alienate the award winners...

## Issues

- Treatment of (B)IPs that were "inherited" before Decred started

  - Will need to get numbers and (B)IPs that fall into category. Current thought is that we need to define a starting point or we may have too many reward recipients.
  - How to deal with ideas that clearly originated from other projects which did not necessarily originate as (B)IPs... e.g. CSPP (credit: jet\_user)

- Recipients may reject our reward or decline being interviewed.

  - We could still spin this in a good light e.g: still publicly acknowledge that a (B)IP was incorporated into Decred because we agree it is a good proposal, how it betters Decred.
  - We can highlight how Decred seeks to incorporate sound ideas which may originate from other projects

- What form the reward should take?

  - A tacky trophy? Giant paper wallet? Honorary contractor giant "cheque"?
  - Something more technical (to illustrate something decred specific would be ideal)...
    - Artwork or something that could be anchored into DCRTime (allowing us to show off DCRTime...)
    - Could we tie this into the launch of the DEX somehow?

- If this is successful, should it continue or be a one-off affair?

- COULD THE MEDIA PUBLICITY BACKFIRE?
