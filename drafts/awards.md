## Executive Summary

This Politea proposal seeks approval in establishing an award for three individuals or parties with talent that may benefit the Decred project who are not currently directly contributing to Decred. It specifies an amount of 1500 DCR for 3 awards be set aside and accessed only if the follow up proposal on media costings for the awards is approved. Shoud the latter fail, or be unable to be produced without cost to the community, no funds will be taken out of the treasury.

## Introduction

Improvement protocols are design documents for introducing new ideas or features into a project. For example, ["Bitcoin Improvement Protocol" (BIP) 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille introduced HD wallets into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This allowed for deterministic wallets to be interchanged between different clients or backed up through the use of seed words. Although not specifically designed for Decred, IPs like this example have been successfully integrated into Decred helping advance the Decred project. Other ideas which make their way into Decred may arise from research publications. For example ["P2P Mixing and Unlinkable Bitcoin Transaction"](https://decred.org/research/ruffing2016.pdf) by Ruffing, Moreno-Sanchez & Kate, form the basis of our privacy implementation. 

The individuals or groups capable of developing IPs or publishing research at this calibre represent a small pool of individuals familiar with blockchain fundamentals who are motivated to improve the blockchain space. They may or may not be already affiliated with a blockchain project. It would be to our benefit that we attract such talent. I propose using a small portion of the treasury funds as an award for IP authors if their work has the potential to contribute to the advancement of Decred. I think 500 DCR per IP represents reasonable acknowledgement of their contribution(s). In the event an author has contributed more than 1 IP, only 1 award will be given out. I propose a total of 3 awards be given out as part of this proposal to limit cost and to test the feasibility of this idea.

I expect the response from the authors will lie on a continuum from "Positive" to "Indifferent" with most feeling acknowledged and validated in some way. I would expect most of them to look into the source of the reward which may form the initial point of contact into Decred. Of course, not everybody that looks at Decred will be attracted to it; others, for political reasons or otherwise, may not want or be able to to publicly acknowledge Decred. Beyond that, there may be some that will seek to vilify this benevolent gift.

The secondary aims of this proposal are to highlight our treasury and governance system as well as generate positive attention from outside our community via the media release. By showing our collective capacity to acknowledge good ideas from everywhere in the crypto space and showing how they were incorporated into Decred, we can demonstrate maturity of thought and our capacity in making decisions that can move the project forward. In doing this, we will ultimately attract more users and developers into our community and strengthen it.

Media networks covering other projects must be tapped so that news about Decred can break outside the bounds of /r/decred and #decred. The award would be pointless if our community receives no benefit. The award should help break down crypto tribalism and build healthy relationships between our community and others.

## Financial Considerations

This proposal is only to seek approval from the Decred community to set aside 500 x 3 DCR to be used at the basis for the awards. This proposal is calculated and paid in DCR as it illustrates the global nature of this project and is also symbolic of our move away from fiat. As author of this proposal, I do not request payment and exclude myself from being a reward nominee or recipient to prevent any conflicts of interest arising.

Costings for media content creation will be factored into the subsequent proposal. It would be ideal if the media team does not request payment in terms of content creation as this may open up a vector for negative comments or criticisms from the outside since it may be perceived as profiteering from the award. However, the economics of the real world may make this impossible, hence the need for transparency and a follow up proposal in which I will detail the pricing for the required content creation in order to put it to vote.

- // Perhaps they could be compensated by community donations (risky as there may be no donors...)
- // What about corporate sponsorship? (This would look bad and possibly BACKFIRE)
- // Could be used as proof of "work" for aspiring media contractors... (Do we have any aspiring authors?) 
- **// Content creators, please drop me a message on Matrix with what you can do and your fee (if any).

## Execution

Candidate Nomination
Award recipients will be nominated by our existing developers/contractors since they represent the group that would have the required knowledge of which improvement protocols or ideas are useful. This document will be sent to our developers/contractors in order to generate a list of nominees. The nomination period will last for 2 weeks after which the list will be published here. 
- // need to decide on where to publish and make link.

Nominee Ranking
Nominees and their corresponding IPs will be open to verification by the public during the "In Discussion" phase of the Politea process. It is expected the nomination phase will result in more than three nominees. For the moment, the binary outcomes from Politea will not allow us to perform any ranking directly through politea, therefore, the only rational choice is for the ranking to be done by our most trusted personnel, which would be Company Zero who would be asked to weigh in on opinions posted on Politea. All nominees would be ranked. // Should there be some scoring template e.g IP significance/"pro-decred-ism"/etc

- // I think it would be reasonable to exclude candidates that are known to be openly hostile towards our project.
- // **Draft of letter to be sent to developers (use dcrtime)
- // **Draft of letter to recipients (use dcrtime)

Outreach Process
Once the nominees have been ranked, the outreach process will start. Outreach to IP authors will be done by individuals well associated to the Decred community, ideally also a known entity on social media. Direct contact should be sought with the award recipients first followed by contact over social media channels if they agree to receive the award. Permission for a short video interview (30 minutes) would be sought. The reasons behind the award should also be stated explicitly.. They will have 10 days to accept or decline from the time contact was made. If the nominees decline or if 10 days have elapsed, then the next nominee down the list will be contacted until the list is exhausted.
- // I'm thinking: Checkmate, richardred, Exitus, permabullnino, jz, ammarooni, svitekpavel <---none of them have been approached yet...
- //[feel free to add your name here!]

Content Creation
Once 3 nominees have accepted the award or if the end of the list has been reached, we will move to secure funding for the content creation. 
- // Is this a good method? Maybe better to secure funding for media first...
- // I'm thinking at least a podcast and 2 articles written up per award <-- comments?
- // My initial thoughts had been to prepare the articles ahead of time, but this could result in work that will not see the light of day and waste time. 

The articles produced could focus on:
- Reason the IP was published, the problem that it identifies and addresses
- Any barriers faced in putting the idea forward, any pushback from the intended community
- Any limitations of the original infrastructure (things that our DCPs address) that would have resulted in more seamless integration
- Any prior awareness of Decred and whether the authors knew their work had been incorporated.
- Our media pieces should also take the opportunity to highlight how funding was obtained to promote our self-sovereign treasury and to distinguish it from how other cryptocurrency projects are funded.

Issues
- // Who would be willing to write? Do we need to vet the documents? I would be happy to but I also realize to the community I am a reasonably unknown entity (by choice).
- // Obtaining expression of interest for social media personnel, interviewers, bloggers, etc.
- // If they do this for a fee we might be perceived as just doing this as a PR stunt which may alienate the award winners...

## Possible Issues
- Recipients may reject our reward or decline being interviewed.
  - We could still spin this in a good light e.g: still publicly acknowledge that a IP was incorporated into Decred because we agree it is a good proposal, how it can better Decred.
  - We can highlight how Decred seeks to incorporate sound ideas which may originate from other projects

- What form the reward should take?
 - A tacky trophy? Giant paper wallet? Honorary contractor giant "cheque"?
  - Something more technical (to illustrate something decred specific would be ideal)...
    - Artwork or something that could be anchored into DCRTime (allowing us to show off DCRTime...)
    - Could we tie this into the launch of the DEX somehow?
    - Someway to tie into DCRTime... 
    - We should also give out some testnet DCR, a 1:1 DCR:tDCR would be aesthetically pleasing.

- If this is successful, should it continue or be a one-off affair?

- COULD THE MEDIA PUBLICITY BACKFIRE?
