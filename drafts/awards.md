## Executive Summary

This Politea proposal seeks approval in establishing an award for three individuals or parties with talent that may benefit the Decred project who are not currently directly contributing to Decred. It specifies an amount of 1500 DCR for 3 awards be set aside and accessed only if the follow up proposal on media costings for the awards is approved. Shoud the latter fail, or be unable to be produced without cost to the community, no funds will be taken out of the treasury.

## Introduction

Improvement protocols are design documents for introducing new ideas or features into a project. For example, ["Bitcoin Improvement Protocol" (BIP) 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille introduced HD wallets into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This allowed for deterministic wallets to be interchanged between different clients or backed up through the use of seed words. Although not specifically designed for Decred, IPs like this example have been successfully integrated into Decred helping advance the Decred project. Other ideas which make their way into Decred may arise from research publications. For example ["P2P Mixing and Unlinkable Bitcoin Transaction"](https://decred.org/research/ruffing2016.pdf) by Ruffing, Moreno-Sanchez & Kate, form the basis of our privacy implementation. 

The individuals or groups capable of developing IPs or publishing research at this calibre represent a small pool of individuals familiar with blockchain fundamentals who are motivated to improve the blockchain space. They may or may not be already affiliated with a blockchain project. It would be to our benefit that we attract such talent. I propose using a small portion of the treasury funds as an award for IP authors if their work has the potential to contribute to the advancement of Decred. I think 500 DCR per IP represents reasonable acknowledgement of their contribution(s). In the event an author has contributed more than 1 IP, only 1 award will be given out. I propose a total of 3 awards be given out as part of this proposal to limit cost and to test the feasibility of this idea.

I expect the response from the authors will lie on a continuum from "Positive" to "Indifferent" with most feeling acknowledged and validated in some way. I would expect most of them to look into the source of the reward which may form the initial point of contact into Decred. Of course, not everybody that looks at Decred will be attracted to it; others, for political reasons, may not want or be able to to publicly acknowledge Decred. Beyond that, there may also be some that will seek to vilify this benevolent gift.

The secondary aims of this proposal are to highlight our treasury and governance system as well as generate positive attention from outside our community. By showing our collective capacity to acknowledge good ideas from everywhere in the crypto space and showing how they were incorporated into Decred, we can demonstrate maturity of thought and our capacity in making decisions that can move the project forward. In doing this, we will ultimately attract more users and developers into our community and strengthen it.

Media networks covering other projects must be tapped so that news about Decred can break outside the bounds of /r/decred and #decred. The award would be pointless if our community receives no benefit. The award should help break down crypto tribalism and build healthy relationships between our community and others.

## Financial Considerations

This proposal is only to seek approval from the Decred community to set aside 500 x 3 DCR to be used at the basis for the awards. This proposal specifically requests the award be calculated and paid in DCR as it illustrates the global nature of this project and is also symbolic of our move away from fiat. As author of this proposal, I do not request payment and exclude myself from being a reward recipient to prevent any conflicts of interest arising.

Costings for media content creation will be factored into the subsequent proposal. I feel it would be ideal if the media team does not request payment in terms of content creation as this may open up a vector for negative comments or criticisms from the outside since it may be perceived as profiteering from the award. However, the economics of the real world may make this impossible, hence the need for transparency and a follow up proposal in which I will detail the pricing for the required content creation in order to put it to vote.

- // Perhaps they could be compensated by community donations (risky as there may be no donors...)
- // What about corporate sponsorship? (Would they go for this? Will this look bad? Worse, BACKFIRE?)
- // Could be used as proof of "work" for aspiring media contractors... (maybe nobody will take the bite)i think 
- // Content creators, please drop me a message on Matrix with what you can do and your fee (if any).

## Execution

Award recipients will be nominated by our existing developers/contractors since no other group would have the required knowledge of which improvement protocols or ideas are useful. Award candidates and their corresponding IPs could be verified by everyone else during the "In Discussion" phase of the Politea process. It is expected there will be more than three award candidates. The final three candidates will be mentioned by name along with their contribution in the Politea proposal during the "Voting" phase of the Politea process.

- // Our contractors only need to identify the idea and author(s) involved so this should not take long.
- // Could just post the question on Matrix (I believe all contractors use Matrix...)
- // The problem would be who to choose if there are more than 3 candidates. Our devs should rank the importance of the contribution first and this could then be discussed on Politea.
- // I think it would be reasonable to exclude candidates that are known to be openly hostile towards our project.
- // **Draft of letter to be sent to developers (use dcrtime)
- // **Draft of letter to recipients (use dcrtime)

Outreach to IP authors should be done by individuals well associated to the Decred community, ideally also a known entity on social media. Direct contact should be sought with the award recipients first followed by contact over social media channels if they agree to receive the award. Permission for a short video interview (30 minutes) would be sought. The reasons behind the award should also be stated explicitly.

- // I'm thinking: Checkmate, richardred, Exitus, permabullnino, jz, ammarooni, svitekpavel [feel free to add your name here!]
- // They've not been approached yet!

Since we would know who the reward recipients will be in advance of the recipients themselves, we should take the opportunity to prepare some media pieces for release. The topics to focus on should include:

- Reason the IP was published, the problem that it identifies and addresses
- Any barriers faced in putting the idea forward, any pushback from the intended community
- Any limitations of the original infrastructure (things that our DCPs address) that would have resulted in more seamless integration

- // Who would be willing to write? Do we need to vet the documents? I would be happy to but I also realize to the community I am a reasonably unknown entity (by choice).

Our media pieces should also take the opportunity to highlight how funding was obtained to promote our self-sovereign treasury and to distinguish it from how other cryptocurrency projects are funded.

- // Obtaining expression of interest for social media personnel, interviewers, bloggers, etc.
- // If they do this for a fee we might be perceived as just doing this as a PR stunt which may alienate the award winners...

## Issues

- Recipients may reject our reward or decline being interviewed.
  - We could still spin this in a good light e.g: still publicly acknowledge that a IP was incorporated into Decred because we agree it is a good proposal, how it can better Decred.
  - We can highlight how Decred seeks to incorporate sound ideas which may originate from other projects

- What form the reward should take?
 - A tacky trophy? Giant paper wallet? Honorary contractor giant "cheque"?
  - Something more technical (to illustrate something decred specific would be ideal)...
    - Artwork or something that could be anchored into DCRTime (allowing us to show off DCRTime...)
    - Could we tie this into the launch of the DEX somehow?
    - Someway to tie into DCRTime... 
    - We should also give out some testnet DCR, a 1:1 DCR:tDCR would be aesthetically pleasing.

- If this is successful, should it continue or be a one-off affair?

- COULD THE MEDIA PUBLICITY BACKFIRE?
