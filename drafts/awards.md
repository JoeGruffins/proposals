## Introduction

Improvement protocols are design documents for introducing new ideas or features into a project. For example, ["Bitcoin Improvement Protocol" (BIP) 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille introduced HD wallets into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This greatly simplified private key management and allowed for deterministic wallets to be interchanged between different clients or backed up through the use of seed words. Although not specifically designed for Decred, IPs like this example have been successfully integrated into Decred helping advance the Decred project. 

Other ideas which make their way into Decred may arise from research publications. For example ["P2P Mixing and Unlinkable Bitcoin Transaction"](https://decred.org/research/ruffing2016.pdf) by Ruffing, Moreno-Sanchez and Kate, form the basis for our privacy implementation. The individuals or groups capable of developing IPs or publishing research like this represent a small pool of developers familiar with blockchain fundamentals who are motivated to improve their respective project. It would be to our benefit that we attract such talent. I propose using a small portion of the treasury funds as an award for IP authors if their work has the potential to contribute to the advancement of the Decred project. I think 500 DCR per IP or idea (henceforth referred to as IP) represents a reasonable acknowledgement of their contribution. The reward will only be given out once in the event an author(s) has contributed more than 1 IP. For the inaugural awards, I propose 3 awards be given out.

I expect the response will lie on a continuum from "Positive" to "Indifferent" with most feeling acknowledged and validated in some way. I would expect most of them to look into the source of the reward which may form the initial point of contact into Decred. Of course, not everybody that looks at Decred will be attracted to it. In the worst case scenero it is entirely possible that they are completely disinterested in our project and move on to sell their award. I believe that many voters will see selling of the awarded DCR as a failure, but this is not necessarily the case.

Whilst most Politea proposals are priced in USD and then converted to DCR, I believe this undermines the value of giving the reward in DCR. This proposal specifically requests the reward be paid out as DCR only as doing so would can incentivize the recipient to work towards increasing the value of DCR held. Having the rewards priced in DCR only also illustrate the global nature of this project and is also symbolic of our move away from fiat.

The secondary aims of this proposal are to highlight our treasury and governance system as well as generate positive attention from outside our community. By showing our capacity to acknowledge good ideas from everywhere in the crypto space and showing how they were incorporated into Decred, we can demonstrate maturity of thought and our collective capacity in making decisions that can move the project forward. In doing this, we will ultimately bring more users and developers into our community and strengthen it.

It would be vital to tap into media networks covering other projects so that news about Decred can break outside the bounds of /r/decred and #decred. I see this as a way to break down crypto tribalism and build healthy relationships between our community and others.

## Financial Considerations

The only funds requested at this time will be those that go to the three awards (500 x 3 DCR). Funds will only be taken from the treaury if the content creation costs have passed through the Politea process (see below).

The author of this proposal does not request payment and excludes himself from being a reward recipient.

The costings for media content creation have not yet been factored in. It would be ideal if the media team does not request payment for this round of awards as I feel it undermines/complicates the essence of the awards and makes us come off looking like we are trying to profiteer from the award. However, the economics of the real world makes this unlikely, hence the need for the follow up proposal. In the follow up proposal, I will put the pricing for the required content creation up for voting.

- // Perhaps they could be compensated by community donations (risky as there may be no donors...)
- // What about corporate sponsorship? (Would they go for this? Will this look bad? Worse, BACKFIRE?)
- // Could be used as proof of "work" for aspiring media contractors... (maybe nobody will take the bite)
- // Content creators, please drop me a message on Matrix with what you can do and your fee (if any).

## Execution

Award recipients will be nominated by our existing developers/ contractors since no other group would have the required knowledge of which improvement protocols or ideas are useful. Award candidates and their corresponding IPs could be verified by everyone else during the "In Discussion" phase of the Politea process. It is expected there will be more than three award candidates. The final three candidates will be mentioned by name along with their contribution in the Politea proposal during the "Voting" phase of the Politea process.

- // Our contractors only need to identify the idea and author(s) involved so this should not take long.
- // Could just post the question on Matrix (I believe all contractors use Matrix...)
- // The problem would be who to choose if there are more than 3 candidates. Our devs should rank the importance of the contribution first and this could then be discussed on Politea.
- // I think it would be reasonable to exclude candidates that are known to be openly hostile towards our project.

Outreach to IP authors should be done by individuals well known, ideally both within the Decred community and also on social media. Direct contact should be sought with the award recipients first followed by contact over social media channels if they agree to receive the award. Permission for a short video interview (30 minutes) would be sought. The reasons behind the award should also be stated explicitly.

- // I'm thinking: Checkmate, richardred, Exitus, permabullnino, jz, ammarooni, svitekpavel [feel free to add your name here!]
- // They've not been approached yet!

Since we would know who the reward recipients will be in advance of the recipients themselves, we should take the opportunity to prepare some media pieces for release. The topics to focus on should include:

- Reason the IP was published, the problem that it identifies and addresses
- Any barriers faced in putting the idea forward, any pushback from the intended community
- Any limitations of the original infrastructure (things that our DCPs address) that would have resulted in more seamless integration

- // Who would be willing to write? Do we need to vet the documents? I would be happy to but I also realize to the community I am a reasonably unknown entity (by choice).

Our media pieces should also take the opportunity to highlight how funding was obtained to promote our self-sovereign treasury and to distinguish it from how other cryptocurrency projects are funded.

- // Obtaining expression of interest for social media personnel, interviewers, bloggers, etc.
- // If they do this for a fee we might be perceived as just doing this as a PR stunt which may alienate the award winners...

## Issues

- Recipients may reject our reward or decline being interviewed.
  - We could still spin this in a good light e.g: still publicly acknowledge that a IP was incorporated into Decred because we agree it is a good proposal, how it can better Decred.
  - We can highlight how Decred seeks to incorporate sound ideas which may originate from other projects

- What form the reward should take?
 - A tacky trophy? Giant paper wallet? Honorary contractor giant "cheque"?
  - Something more technical (to illustrate something decred specific would be ideal)...
    - Artwork or something that could be anchored into DCRTime (allowing us to show off DCRTime...)
    - Could we tie this into the launch of the DEX somehow?
    - Someway to tie into DCRTime... 
    - We should also give out some testnet DCR, a 1:1 DCR:tDCR would be aesthetically pleasing.

- If this is successful, should it continue or be a one-off affair?

- COULD THE MEDIA PUBLICITY BACKFIRE?
