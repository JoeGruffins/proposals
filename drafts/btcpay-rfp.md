RFP BTCPayServer

Software Feature Proposal

Motivation
As our community grows and more contractors around the world earn DCR it becomes a necessity to provide solutions that enable DCR users to spend their Decred as they please. Even though, we are putting critical emphasis on the Store of Value narrative, it is important to start thinking about the software solutions that can enable to close links in the Decred economy. Providing open source infrastructure for this end is important in order to have these links ready when Decred grows and people want to integrate DCR as a payment solution and use DCR as a medium of exchange. Furthermore, BTCPayServer is the most decentralised solution for merchant points of sale aligning with Decred’s ethos of decentralisation and open-source infrastructure. 

What
Integrate Decred into the BTCPayServer in order to facilitate Decred’s merchant acceptance through the standard open source infraestructure BtcPayServer is an open-source, self-hosted cryptocurrency payment processor that allows merchants to not depend on any third-party to accept payments where each deployment requires users to have their own full node.
