** Introduction

BIPs are design documents for introducing new features into Bitcoin (similar "improvement proposal" systems exist for other Blockchain projects). For example, BIP 32 by Pieter Wuille introduced HD wallets into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This greatly simplified private key management and allowed for deterministic wallets to be interchanged between different clients or backed up through the use of seed words. Although not specifically designed for Decred, BIPs like this example have been successfully integrated into Decred helping advance the Decred project. Since the inception of Decred @davecgh estimates 4 BIPs have been incorporated. 

The individuals or groups capable of developing BIPs represent a small pool of developers familiar with Blockchain fundamentals who are interested in improving Bitcoin. It would be to our benefit that we attract such talent. I propose using a small portion of the treasury funds as a reward for BIP or other "IP" authors if their work has contributed to the advancement of the Decred project. I think 1000 DCR per BIP [actual amount to be decided upon later via feedback] represents a reasonable acknowledgement of their work. The reward will only be given out once in the event an author has contributed more than 1 BIP.

I expect the response will lie on a continuum from "Positive" to "Indifferent". I would expect most would feel acknowledged and validated in some way. I would expect most of them to look into the source of the reward which may form the initial point of contact into Decred. Of course, not everybody that looks at Decred will be attracted to it, but I expect programmers with an understanding of blockchain fundamentals will appreciate the unique features offered by our Blockchain project and hopefully this will incentivize them to contribute.

Whilst most Politea proposals are priced in USD and then converted to DCR, I believe this undermines the value of giving the reward in DCR. This proposal specifically requests the reward be paid out as DCR only as doing so would can incentivize the recipient to work towards increasing the value of DCR held. Having the rewards priced in DCR only also illustrate the global nature of this project and is also symbolic of our move away from fiat.

The secondary aims of this proposal are to generate positive media buzz for Decred as well as to highlight our treasury and governance system.  By being able to acknowledge good ideas from everywhere in the crypto space and showing how they were incorporated into Decred, we can demonstrate maturity of thought and the collective capacity to make decisions that can move the project forward. In doing this, we will ultimately bring more users and developers into our community and strengthen it.

Prior to recipients being announced: podcasters, bloggers, twitter, facebook and other social media personalities should be tapped to give them lead time to prepare. I feel it is vital to tap into media networks covering other projects (ideally projects the (B)IP authors are involved in) as a way to break down crypto tribalism and build relationships between crypto communities.

** Financial
The only funds requested are those that go to the rewards (1000 DCR per reward)
The author of this proposal does not request payment.


** Execution

Reward recipients will necessarily have to be put forward by our coding contractors since no other group would have the required knowledge. Reward recipients and their corresponding (B)IPs could be verified by everybody else in during the 'In Discussion' phase of the Politea process. The recipients will all be mentioned by name along with their contribution in during the 'Voting" phase of the Politea process.

Outreach to (B)IP authors should be done by individuals well known, ideally both within the Decred community and also on social media. Direct contact should be sought with the authors first followed by contact over social media channels. Permission for a short interview (30 minutes) would be sought and should focus on the reason the (B)IP was created.

Since we would know who the reward recipients will be in advance of the recipients themselves, we should take the opportunity to prepare some media pieces for release. The topics to focus on should include:

- Reason the (B)IP was created, the problem that it identifies and addresses
- Any barriers faced in putting the idea forward, any push back from the intended community
- Any limitations of the original infrastructure (things that our DCPs address) that would have resulted in more seamless integration

Our media pieces should also take the opportunity to highlight how funding was obtained to promote our self sovereign treasury and to distinguish it from how other cryptocurrency projects are funded.

** Issues

-Obtaining expression of interest for social media personnel, interviewers, bloggers, etc.
--> Will our writers/media team be willing to do the interviews/write-ups for no cost? Having to factor in their cost will complicate this proposal.
----> Perhaps they could be compensated by donations (risky as there may be no donors...)
----> Could be used as proof of 'work' for aspiring contractors...

- Treatment of (B)IPs that were 'inherited' before Decred started
--> Will need to get numbers and (B)IPs that fall into category. Current thought is that we need to define a start point or we may have too many reward recipients.
--> Treatment of ideas that clearly originated from other projects which did not necessarily originate as (B)IPs... e.g. CSPP (credit: jet_user)

- Recipients may reject our reward or decline being interviewed.
--> We could still spin this in a good light e.g: still publicly acknowledge that a (B)IP was incorporated into Decred because we agree it is a good proposal, how it betters Decred.
--> We can highlight how Decred seeks to incorporate sound ideas which may originate from other projects

- What form the reward should take?
--> A tacky trophy? Giant paper wallet? Honorary contractor giant 'cheque'?
--> Something more technical (to illustrate something decred specific would be ideal)...

- If this is successful, should it continue or be a one off affair?

- COULD THE MEDIA PUBLICITY BACKFIRE?

@richard red comments:
Hey, no problem
it's missing some detail on how it would work in practice. who selects the recipients? how does a recipient accept or reject this reward? how do we know the DCR is really being paid to the right person?
would the BIP authors have to come and claim it or does someone seek them out?

@checkmatey
The idea is interesting but im really not sure about it. What BIPs or devs would you be considering?
To be honest, I would rather put up bounties for those interested to do work for the project
Remember, DCR was built from its own Bitcoin implementation. The decred devs already gifted that tech for free 
LND wouldnt exist without it
And that code was shunned and cursed by the bitcoin.devs
Despite being quality code and very useful.
I dont believe this is a great way to earn much more than 1000DCR worth of sell pressure.

@davecgh
That really largely depends if you want to consider early BIPs well before Decred ever started that were inherited.
I would say those probably really don't matter since Decred didn't exist.  Since then though, I think 4

@jet_user
In a way Decred is already taking advantage of the thoughtwork done for some BIPs. Talking about client-side filters of course (BIP 157 and 158). A related thing is CSPP, which iirc does not have a BIP. What both of these pieces of work have in common is that they received a serious engineering effort to implement in Decred. I think people who have spent significant effort developing these ideas would be happy to know they came to reality in Decred, even though they were originally intended for another system.

Airdropping DCR on these talented people is a very interesting idea in line with our builder culture. I cannot lead organizing this, but if someone does I'd throw a few DCR in the pool!
